# ParallelElf
Parallel Selections in main memory index structures(Elf) for Databases

This <a href="http://elf.ovgu.de/">link</a> gives an overview of Elf and the state of art sequential search for the selection predicates. In this project, we tried to implement the index traversal in two parallel variants (Subtree and Node level). More details are given in the  <a href=https://github.com/rtgunti/ParallelElf/blob/master/Report%20-%20Parallel%20Selections%20in%20Elf.pdf">report</a>
